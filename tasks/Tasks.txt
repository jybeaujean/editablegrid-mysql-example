TODO
1) Fix Pagination styling

2) Error handling/reporting
Currently when things go wrong, very hard to debug and tell what went wrong.
I need the error handling updated so we can see what is going on.

Whenever there is a database operation or other error, log a descriptive error
a) by the red coloring it seems to do in the cell
b) in the message area? (is this used by the product?)
c) to the javascript console

Log database operations to db.log
Ajax operations can be logged to a file

3) Handle datetime field in database.
Always show dates and datetimes in iso format
0000-00-00 for dates and 0000-00-00 00:00:00 for datetimes
with dates, the clue is it goes red as soon as you click on it.

TO BE DISCUSSED
Read table configuration from a csv file (e.g. metadata, readonly or editable, display or not)
Security?
