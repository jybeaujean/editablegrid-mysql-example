TODO
1) Fix Pagination styling

2) Error handling/reporting
Currently when things go wrong, very hard to debug and tell what went wrong.
I need the error handling updated so we can see what is going on.

Whenever there is a database operation or other error, log a descriptive error
a) by the red coloring it seems to do in the cell
b) in the message area? (is this used by the product?)
c) to the javascript console

Log database operations to db.log
Ajax operations can be logged to a file

3) Handle datetime field in database.
Always show dates and datetimes in iso format
0000-00-00 for dates and 0000-00-00 00:00:00 for datetimes
with dates, the clue is it goes red as soon as you click on it.

4) TABLE CONFIGURATION
When initialising the table, 
if tablename.spec.tsv exists, use that
Else if tablename.tsv exists, use that
Else 
	The database table metatdata should be scanned by querying information_schema in a way which is portable to mysql and postgres.
	run the [mysql|pgsql]_meta.sql query
	write the results to tablename.tsv
	use the results

5) PRIMARY KEY
Primary key and whether it autoincrements should be identified from the table above
NB. this means if the primary key being named "id" is hardcoded in the solution, this needs to be changed.
IF there is auto_increment, use that.
If not, then find the maximum id and increment
